# GPlayer

GPlayer is simple mp3/aac/ogg/flac player for Android that uses GStreamer as base.

GPlayer currently uses GStreamer version 1.6.1,
GStreamer's Android precompiled binaries and headers, can be found here:
http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/android/1.6.1/

There is no need to compile GStreamer from sources.
