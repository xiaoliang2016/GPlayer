GStreamer uses Lesser GPL license: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html

3.
GStreamer is modular, there is not much core itself, GStreamer SDK/Library is plugin based,
list of all available plugins: http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/plugins.html
GStreamer can be divided into groups:
- core - GStreamer itself, LGPL licensing,
- gst-plugins-base - base plugins, LGPL licensing,
- gst-plugins-good - plugins for "everyday use", LGPL licensing,
- gst-plugins-bad - working but bad documentation for example, LGPL licensing,
- gst-plugins-ugly - good plugins but can have various licensing issues,
- proprietary plugins

4.
unlike GPL, LGPL allows to make your own licensing policy while using LGPL based software,
if you want to modify LGPL licensed code to make it working, you need to publish that code after modifications.

5.
making GStreamer Android based media player does not require to modify any of LGPL licensed software that comes with GStreamer,
we can get GStreamer prebuild libraries/plugins/codecs and wrap them with our own media player's logic implementation,
if there are doubts, lets make GStreamer based Android/iOS media player and then publish its whole code under LGPL.

6.
Aupeo requires only few audio decoders to work correctly, we do not need to use bad/ugly/proprietary plugins to get GStreamer in use.
